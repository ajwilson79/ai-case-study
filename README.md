## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

* When was the company incorporated?

* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

JPMorgan Chase, a financial institution with a rich history, was incorporated in 2000 through the merger of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Chase Manhattan Corporation, though its roots trace back to 1799 with the founding of The Bank of The Manhattan Company. The original J.P. Morgan & Co., established by J. Pierpont Morgan in 1871, and The Manhattan Company, founded by Aaron Burr in 1799, were pivotal in shaping the early American financial landscape. 

The inception of JPMorgan Chase as it is known today was the result of a series of mergers and acquisitions, a strategic move that consolidated its position as a global financial leader. Funded primarily through its banking and investment services, JPMorgan Chase has grown to become one of the largest and most influential financial entities in the world, steering clear of the need for external funding rounds typical of newer companies. This self-sustaining financial powerhouse stands as a testament to the enduring vision of its founders and the innovative evolution of its business model over centuries.
